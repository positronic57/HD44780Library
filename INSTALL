HD44780Library Installation Manual


This short HOWTO describes the installation procedure for HD44780Library on Linux.

Prerequisites:
- GNU binutils and GNU gcc compiler built for AVR targets;
- AVR-libc.


Installation

1. Navigate to the library folder.
2. Build the library with:

        #make

3. Install the library by executing:

        #sudo make install

The destination folder is defined by two variables in the Makefile: $PREFIX and $MCU.
$MCU defines the target AVR MCU. By default, the library is installed in:

        /usr/lib/avr/lib/$MCU

or
        /usr/lib/avr/lib/atmega32

While the default destination for the library header file is:

        /usr/lib/avr/include

The source is compiled with MCU clock set to 4MHz by default. To change this value, update the
definition of the $CPU_FREQ variable in the Makefile.


Uninstalling the library

        #sudo make uninstall
