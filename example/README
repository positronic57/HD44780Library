Install HD44780Library before compiling this example.

The build script assumes that the library and the header files are installed in the default locations
(they are stated in the INSTALL manual of the library).

If that is not the case, adjust the variables: LIBRARY_PATH and HEADERS_PATH in Makefile with the
appropriate values.


Building the Example

Build the code with:

  #make 


MCU and CPU Frequency

Use "mcu" and "cpu_freq" command line arguments when calling "make" tool for specifying 
the AVR8 target device and its CPU frequency. They should be the same with the values used 
for building the library.

For example:
 
  #make mcu=atmega8 cpu_freq=8000000L

The default values are "atmega32" and "4000000L".

Hardware

The header of the source code contains information how the LCD module is connected to the
Atmega32 MCU. Four pins from PORTB are used for data transfer and three pins for control.
